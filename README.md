# 🚢 Titanic Survival - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the Titanic dataset to identify patterns that influenced survival.

## 🔍 Goals
- Understand the structure of the dataset
- Visualize survival rates by gender, age, and class
- Identify missing data and prepare for future modeling

## 📊 Key Techniques Used
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- EDA techniques like histograms, countplots, boxplots, and heatmaps

## 📁 Dataset
[→ Titanic Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Handle missing data (Age, Cabin)
- Train logistic regression & decision tree models
- Submit prediction to Kaggle
